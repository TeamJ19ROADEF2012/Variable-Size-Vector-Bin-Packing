Variable Size Vector Bin Packing
================================

This repository contains heuristics and results for the variable size vector bin
packing problem.

Problem and results are detailed in the paper
http://hal.archives-ouvertes.fr/hal-00868016

The directory src/python provides a flexible implementation of the heuristics,
in Python. Implemented measures and algorithms are not optimized but still run
very fast using PyPy interpreter.

Results are provided in the results directory.
